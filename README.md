# Invoice_extractor_LLM

Project Overview:

This project aims to develop an end-to-end solution for extracting information from invoices in multiple languages using the Google Gemini Pro Free Large Language Model (LLM). By leveraging the capabilities of advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the system will automatically extract relevant data fields from invoices, such as vendor information, invoice numbers, dates, and amounts, regardless of the language used in the invoice.

Features:

Multi-Language Support: The project supports extraction from invoices written in various languages, enhancing its versatility and applicability across different regions and industries.

Google Gemini Pro Free LLM Model: The project utilizes the Google Gemini Pro Free Large Language Model (LLM) for robust and accurate natural language processing, ensuring high-quality extraction results.

End-to-End Solution: From inputting the invoice to extracting structured data, the project provides a seamless end-to-end solution, simplifying the invoice processing workflow.

Usage:

Input: Provide the invoice documents in PDF or image format to the system.
Processing: The system utilizes the Google Gemini Pro Free LLM Model to analyze and extract relevant information from the invoices.
Output: Extracted data fields such as vendor details, invoice numbers, dates, and amounts are presented in a structured format for further processing or integration with other systems.
